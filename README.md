## Four Types of data Analysis
- ### Descriptive Analysis
  - Descriptive analysis answers the “what happened” by summarizing past data, usually in the form of dashboards.
- ### Diagnostic Analysis
  - After asking the main question of “what happened”, the next step is to dive deeper and ask why did it happen? This is where diagnostic analysis comes in.
    Diagnostic analysis takes the insights found from descriptive analytics and drills down to find the causes of those outcome Example - Marketing company drilling down to   determine which marketing activities increased trials.
- ### Predictive Analysis
  - Predictive analysis attempts to answer the question “what is likely to happen”. This type of analytics utilizes previous data to make predictions about future outcomes. This analysis relies on statistical modeling, which requires added technology and manpower to forecast
    examples - Risk Assessment, Sales Forecasting
 - ### Prescriptive Analysis
   - The final type of data analysis is the most sought after, combining the insight from all previous analyses to determine the course of action to take in a current problem or decision. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a perfect example of prescriptive analytics. AI systems consume a large amount of data to continuously learn and use this information to make informed decisions.
